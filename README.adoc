> This is an opinionated devcontainer for building REST APIs with Spring Boot. It is not meant to be a complete solution for all use cases, but rather a starting point that covers the most common challenges of building production grade REST services. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.

== TL;DR
DevContainer for Spring Boot development that gets you covered for all major challenges of building production grade REST services.

== What's inside?
This is a devcontainer for building REST APIs with Spring Boot. It includes all the tools you need to build, test, monitor and deploy your app. 

Let's have a look at the main components:
* OpenJDK 17  
* Spring Boot
* Maven 
* MS SQL 2022
* Prometheus
* Grafana
* Alertmanager
* Mailcatcher
* Adminer
* JaCoCo
* Bruno

=== Development
Develop your Service based on OpenJDK 17. 

For illustration I added an example REST-Service that manages data on games. 
This service exposes some technical metrics: JVM, Hibernate, Spring-Booot (Requests, Errors, etc.) and application specific metrics like the number of games in the database. 

To assist your journey of building high quality web services i added JaCoCo maven plugin. Each time you run `./mvnw package` the code coverage is calculated and stored in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`. Use the included https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer[Live server] extension to view the report in your browser.

=== Testing

I ship my examples with https://www.usebruno.com[Bruno] collections.

Please find the collections in the `bruno` folder. You can import them into Bruno by clicking on the `+` icon in the top left corner and selecting `Import Collection`.

There's a CLI tool to run collections, too:
```
❯ bru run . --reporter-html results.html
Running Folder

> I like Bruno - open source, local execution, no cloud services required. 
Support for GUI and CLI. Excellent support for adding asserts and test to your requests.

=== Persistence

Is implemented by MS SQL 2022. 
This setup ships with an empty database. Using Bruno you can easily create items or upload the a set of default games. By default the service default games are loaded from file:///./games-service/src/(resources/board-games.json[] on startup if the db is empty.


=== Monitoring
The devcontainer includes Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager to monitor your app.
Never underestimate the importance of monitoring your app. It is crucial to know how your app is doing in production. This setup includes everything you need to get started to monitor your app and to be notified when something goes wrong.

> For me gathering metrics & generating appropriate alerts is key to enable us to run a reliable platform. Dashboards are great to visualize the metrics, but alerts are crucial to be notified when something goes wrong. Dashboards should be build in a way that makes it easy to spot issues, but they are not a replacement for alerts. Alerts should be configured in a way that they are triggered when something is wrong, but not too often to avoid alert fatigue.

==== Prometheus
is configured to scrape metrics from the app and from the host system

==== Grafana
is used to visualize the collected metrics. This setup ships with a preconfigured datasource connection to prometheus.
You only need to add a dashboard to show Spring boot metrics. For starters you can try https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/19004-spring-boot-statistics/[dashboard 19004]:

1. Open Grafana - default credentials are `admin`/`admin`: `.env` file contains the default password -> GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD.

2. You can import this dashboard by clicking on the `+` icon in the left sidebar and selecting `Import`. Then paste the dashboard ID `19004` into the input field and click on `Load`. You can then select the Prometheus datasource and click on `Import`.

==== Alertmanager
is used to send notifications when an alert is triggered. Since you definitely want to be notified when your app is down or when something goes wrong, I added a simple alerting rule that will trigger an alert when the app is down. To keep it simple the alerts will be sent via email to a local mailtcatcher.
image::https://github.com/CWACoderWithAttitude/dc-spring-boot-all-in-one/blob/what-the-heck/images/mailcatcher-alert-messages.png[Mailcatcher Alert Messages]

==== Mailcatcher
can be reached at http://localhost:1080/[http://localhost:1080] (You can test the email notification by sending a test email to the configured SMTP server.)
This is an app that accepts SMTP mail connections.Received mails are shown in a web gui. This is a great way to test email notifications without having to set up a real SMTP server.

=== DB Frontend

To make is as easy for you as possible i included difffent ways to peek into the datase. One is a web based GUI, the other is a CLI tool.

=== GUI

Adminer is a web based DB management tool that can be used to manage your database. It can be reached at http://localhost:8010/?mssql=mssql.local&username=sa&db=msdb&ns=dbo[http://localhost:8010]. Please lookup the DB password fron file://.devcontainer/.env[.env] file - look out for property `mssql_sa_password`.

=== CLI

In case you prefer CLI I included `mssql-tools`:

> The DB password for the `sa` user is stored in the `.env` file as `mssql_sa_password`. It's injected into the mssql-tools container in docker-compoose as `MSSQL_PASSWORD`.

```bash
docker exec -it mssql.local /bin/bash
root@2f8bd524f7bf:/# sqlcmd -S mssql.local -U sa -P ${MSSQL_PASSWORD}
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases

=== Why?
When developing a REST API you need to think about a lot of things. You need to think about how to test your code, how to monitor it, how to deploy it and how to make sure it runs in a container. This is a lot of stuff to think about. So I thought it would be a good idea to build a full blown REST API that covers all these topics. The goal is to show you how to do all this stuff in a simple way. The goal is not to build the best API ever. 

=== Why devcontainers?
We all know "Works on my machine" is a bad slogan. What if "works on my machine" simply means: great - ship it. What if we could turn "works on my machine" into "works in a container"? An envirnment that is consistent regardless of the host system.
I want to show you why we should embrace the slogan "It works on my machine". Using devcontainers it is easy to build your product in an environment that's pretty close to your prod env. Let's face it - we all have different machines and different setups. When using containers starting from day one you can be suree
